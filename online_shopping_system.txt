PROGRESSIVE PROJECT
Online Shopping System (OSS)
1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document outlines the functional and non
functional requirements for the development of an Online Shopping Mart platform for a
global retail giant. This document will serve as the primary reference for the development
team during the implementation phase.

1.2 Scope
The Online Shopping Mart will be a comprehensive e-commerce platform allowing
customers to browse products, place orders, make payments, and track deliveries. The system
will also include an administrative interface for inventory management, order processing, and
customer service.
